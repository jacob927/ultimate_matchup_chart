# ultimate_matchup_chart
Data-based matchup chart for Smash Ultimate

Steps I will take

1. **Data Collection**: Use https://github.com/smashdata/ThePlayerDatabase to get results.
    Use both rankings and game data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Only use match data with characters included, only use data from current patch.
    Ideally if there is enough data, only use matches from high level players. If not, make sure players are similarly ranked.
3. **Define Metrics**: How exactly will I be determining the matchup difficulty for each player. Idk that what ChatGPT is for.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate win rates between characters.
    Determine statistical significance.
5. **Visualization**: Create the viz in a large table. Possibly use Tableau to make the data interactive.
6. **Make Money**
